        q: "What licenses and permits are required for non-Arizona residents?",
        a: "Out-of-state OHVs designed primarily for unimproved terrain and weighing 2,500 lbs or less must display a valid OHV decal to operate on public and state trust lands. Qualifying nonresident OHVs must obtain a nonresident decal and complete the required course. A nonresident decal is not the same as street-legal registration, and many short-term visitors won't qualify for one. Confirm requirements before bringing the vehicle to Arizona.",
      },
      {
        q: "What types of vehicles are appropriate?",
        a: "The network is intended primarily for OHVs capable of current route conditions: width, wheelbase, clearance, tires, range, and driver experience all matter. AZAT can't promise every segment is passable by every ATV, UTV, motorcycle, Jeep, or pickup.",

      },
      {
        q: "Are motorcycles okay?",
        a: "Motorcycle suitability depends on the route, road status, rider skill, range, and legal access. Riders are responsible for confirming their vehicle class is allowed on each road they use.",
      },
      {
        q: "What vehicle equipment is required?",
        a: "Requirements depend on vehicle type, registration, location, and whether travel occurs on a road or trail. Consult the current Arizona MVD OHV guide and Arizona law for lights, brakes, horn, mirror, muffler, spark arrestor, plate display, seating, helmets, and other equipment. Carrying emergency equipment doesn't substitute for legally required equipment.",

      {
        q: "What rules apply on National Forest roads?",
        a: "Motor vehicle use is governed by the applicable National Forest Motor Vehicle Use Map, posted signs, closures, and forest orders. Use only roads and trails open to your vehicle class and season of use.",
      },
      {
        q: "What rules apply on Arizona State Trust land?",
        a: "An OHV decal may authorize travel across State Trust land on existing roads and trails, but it does not authorize stopping, staging, parking, camping, or other recreation. Those activities require the appropriate Recreational Permit. Trust land is not the same as public land, and access is not guaranteed.",

      {
        q: "Is the website map enough for navigation?",
        a: "No. The website map and printed overview map are planning aids only. Remote travel requires an offline-capable navigation device or app, the current route file, and a second navigation method. Cell service is unreliable in many parts of Eastern Arizona, so don't depend on a live web map or one phone.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I import a GPX file?",
        a: "Install and test a GPX-compatible app or device before the trip. Download the current AZAT GPX file, import it according to your app or device instructions, confirm the track appears correctly, and save an offline copy.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do the GPX downloads include waypoints and points of interest?",
        a: "Yes, the official download package includes waypoints alongside the route tracks. Confirm your app is set to import both, since some apps only load one by default.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use a route file obtained from another website or friend?",
        a: "Treat third-party files as uncontrolled copies. Compare the version and date with the official AZAT download. Old files may contain obsolete routes, private-property conflicts, closures, or missing reroutes.",
      },
      {
        q: "What do segment names and codes mean?",
        a: "AZAT divides the developing network into named or coded segments between route junctions and communities. Each segment page identifies its endpoints, approximate distance, route status, surface, governing land managers, vehicle considerations, known services, and last verification date.",

      },
      {
        q: "Why isn't the AZAT on OnX?",
        a: "Third-party navigation platforms control their own data and update schedules. Use the official AZAT files as the source of truth. If you also use OnX, Trails Offroad, Google Maps, or another tool, compare it against the current AZAT download and field conditions.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are there road numbers or turn-by-turn directions?",

      },
      {
        q: "What if the route conflicts with a sign, gate, or closure?",

      },
      {
        q: "How many days should I allow?",
        a: "There's no universal answer. Daily progress depends on route status, surface, weather, group size, vehicle type, fuel stops, photography, side trips, and mechanical delays. Build conservative days with at least one contingency option rather than planning only by mileage.",

      {
        q: "How can I find a group to ride with?",

        q: "How difficult is the AZAT?",
        a: "Difficulty varies by segment and can change rapidly after storms, snowmelt, traffic, erosion, maintenance, or wildfire. AZAT hasn't yet adopted a field-verified difficulty rating system, so don't infer difficulty from mileage or road classification alone.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the best season, and when does the seasonal closure start?",
        a: "No single season is best everywhere. Higher country may have snow, ice, mud, or seasonal closures; lower areas can be dangerously hot; summer monsoons can bring lightning, flooding, and impassable roads. Closures and reopenings are set by each land manager based on conditions, so check current alerts before assuming a section is open.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I camp along the route?",
        a: "Camping rules depend on the land manager and location. Some areas allow dispersed camping, others require developed sites or permits, and State Trust land has separate permit conditions. Never camp on private land, block a road, or assume a pullout is a legal campsite. Check current fire restrictions before your trip, since camping and campfires may be banned in specific areas during dry periods.",

      },
      {
        q: "What should I carry?",
        a: "Equipment should match the route, season, people, and vehicle. At minimum, plan for delayed travel and an overnight emergency: water and food beyond the planned duration, a first-aid kit and required medications, offline navigation and backup communication, a repair kit and vehicle-specific spares, recovery equipment for the terrain, and a fire extinguisher, flashlight, and basic shelter.",

      {
        q: "Can I rely on cellular service or trail repeaters?",

It is designed primarily for responsible OHV travel while connecting gateway communities and supporting rural tourism, using a mixture of forest roads, county roads, local streets, highways, and other existing routes. Important: the AZAT is a route network, not one continuously constructed trail. Individual roads and segments remain under the authority of their respective land managers and road agencies.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the AZAT complete and officially designated?",
        a: "No single statement applies to every mile. AZAT publishes a developing alignment, but some portions remain preliminary or require additional coordination. A route shown by AZAT may use an existing legal road while the larger branded network is still under development. Riders must verify current access and obey posted closures, signs, gates, and agency orders.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long is the AZAT trail?",
        a: "More than 700 miles, counting town-to-town trails; side trails add more. The exact total shifts with route version, connectors, and reroutes, so treat any published number as an estimate, not a fixed count.",
      },
      {

      },
      {
        q: "Why are gateway communities part of the project?",
        a: "They give riders access to fuel, meals, lodging, repairs, supplies, and local information, while responsible visitor spending creates economic value for the rural communities the route connects.",
      },
      {
        q: "What trails or roads does the AZAT follow?",

      },
      {
        q: "Are there different trails between the towns?",

        q: "Who manages the AZAT?",
        a: "Arizona Alpine Trail, Inc. is an Arizona nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that develops, documents, maintains, and promotes the network in cooperation with communities, counties, agencies, land managers, volunteers, and other partners. AZAT does not replace the legal authority of those agencies or landowners.",
